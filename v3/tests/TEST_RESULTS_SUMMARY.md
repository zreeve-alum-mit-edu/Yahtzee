## Test Categories

### 1. test_dice_rolling.py
- **Z=1 Tests:** 14 tests, 12 passed, 2 failed
- **Z>1 Tests:** 9 tests, 5 passed, 4 failed

**Failed Tests:**
- `test_initial_upper_scores_unscored` - Upper scorecard initialization pattern issue
- `test_clear_resets_upper_scores_to_unscored` - Clear function not resetting upper scores correctly
- `test_initial_scores_independent_z` - Z dimension scorecard initialization issue
- `test_clear_resets_all_z` - Clear not working across all Z dimensions
- `test_large_z_initialization` - Issues with large Z values
- `test_z_dimension_consistency` - Turn tensor dimension mismatch

### 2. test_score_category.py  
- **Z=1 Tests:** 9 tests, 6 passed, 3 failed
- **Z>1 Tests:** 8 tests, 4 passed, 4 failed

**Failed Tests:**
- `test_score_already_scored_category` - Returns -100 instead of 0 for already scored
- `test_categories_marked_as_scored` - Category marking not working correctly
- `test_upper_bonus_calculation` - Bonus calculation issues
- `test_score_different_games_z3` - Multi-game scoring issues
- `test_upper_bonus_with_multiplier_z2` - Bonus multiplier not applied correctly
- `test_all_categories_available_z4` - Category availability checking
- `test_large_z_scoring` - Large Z scoring issues

### 3. test_scoring_consistency.py
- **Z=1 Tests:** 7 tests, 3 passed, 4 failed  
- **Z>1 Tests:** 5 tests, 3 passed, 2 failed

**Failed Tests:**
- `test_already_scored_returns_zero` - Already scored category handling
- `test_bonus_threshold_exact` - Exact bonus threshold not working
- `test_bonus_not_awarded_below_63` - Bonus being awarded incorrectly
- `test_parallel_games_independent_bonuses` - Bonus independence across games
- `test_bonus_with_multiplier_z2` - Multiplier bonus calculation
- `test_independent_bonuses_across_z` - Z dimension bonus independence

## Common Issues Identified

1. **Upper Scorecard Initialization:** The upper scorecard isn't initializing with the correct pattern [0,0,0,0,0,0,1]

2. **Already Scored Categories:** When a category is already scored, the system returns -100 instead of 0

3. **Bonus Calculation:** Upper section bonus calculation and threshold detection has multiple issues

4. **Turn Tensor:** The turn tensor has dimension mismatches with Z

5. **Clear Function:** The clear() method isn't properly resetting scorecards across Z dimensions

6. **Category Marking:** Categories aren't being properly marked as scored/unscored

## Notes
- All tests were ported from v2 with Z=1 compatibility tests
- Additional tests were created for Z>1 scenarios
- Tests are designed to verify both backward compatibility (Z=1) and new multi-game functionality (Z>1)
- No fixes were applied to the code - only test errors were documented
